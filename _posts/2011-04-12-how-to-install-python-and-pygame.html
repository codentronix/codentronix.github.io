<p>Python is a very powerful yet simple language. One of its advantages is the availability of many libraries. One special library is the <strong>Pygame library</strong> that is suited to do <strong>computer graphics</strong> and <strong>make games</strong>. This tutorial will guide you step by step installing Python and Pygame.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> If you don't have both Python and Pygame, make sure you install Python first.</p>
<h2>Installing Python</h2>
<h3>Windows or Mac</h3>
<p>The installation process for Windows and Mac operating systems is pretty easy. Just go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://python.org/download">http://python.org/download</a> and download the appropriate setup package for your Operating System. After that, just run the setup package.</p>
<h3>Linux/BSD</h3>
<p>If  you are using a Linux or BSD system, chances are, you already have python installed. To find out  open a shell program and enter the command  "python -V".  If you get something like shown below, then you have python installed.</p>
<pre>$ python -V
Python 2.7.1
</pre>
<p>However, if you get an error message, then, you don't have python installed. You can install it in one of these 3 ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install using your operating system package management  system (like apt-get on Ubuntu, yum on Fedora, pkg_add in FreeBSD, etc).</li>
<li>Install by source. This is recommended for advanced users. You can find the source on <a rel="nofollow" href="http://python.org/download">http://python.org/download</a>.</li>
<li>Search for a ready built package doing a web search for <em>Python +  [Your operating system]</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other platforms</h3>
<p>For other platforms, first try with the package management system (well, if it does exist). If unsuccessful, try doing a web search for a ready built package, doing a web search for <em>Python +  [Your operating system].</em></p>
<h2>Installing Pygame</h2>
<p>First, make sure you have python installed. After that, go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://pygame.org/download.shtml">http://pygame.org/download.shtml</a>. There, you will find download links ordered by operating system and python version. Pick the appropriate link to your operating system and make sure to install the correct version for your python version. For example, if you were using Windows and Python 2.6 you would follow the link for <em>pygame-1.9.1.win32-py2.6.msi</em>. Finally, after downloading the package, install it, and you are done.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To install python and pygame, we must install python first. On Windows or Mac systems,we just go to  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://python.org/download">http://python.org/download</a>, download the package and install it. For Linux or BSD, it is highly probable that python is already installed. If not, we install it using the operating system's package management system. To install pygame, we go to <a href="http://pygame.org/download.shtml">http://pygame.org/download.shtml</a> and download the appropriate package for our operating system and python version.</p>
