<p>In this tutorial I will show you how to write to a Character LCD using an arduino microcontroller. This will be the first part of a series of tutorials on driving Character LCDs. In this first part I will keep the things simple and easy. I will just show you how to wire the LCD to the Arduino, and write some text to it.</p>
