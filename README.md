This is the source code of the **CODENTRONIX** blog hosted at http://codentronix.com.

The blog was previously self-hosted and based on *WordPress*. I decided later to make it static and host it with *GitHub Pages*.

I have used Jekyll import tools to import all posts from WordPress. The comments now are powered by **DISQUS**.
